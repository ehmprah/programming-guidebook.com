As a developer you're doing a lot of things on the internet and you leave traces everywhere you go, which other people use to get an impression of your personality and your skills. This is generally true, but for programmers even more so.

When you put your code in public repositories on GitHub for example, when you're using social media or ask and answer questions on communities like Stack Overflow — all this information can and will be used to get an idea of you and your skills.

You can see that as a curse; I for one think it's a blessing and a chance, because your digital profiles can help a lot in convincing a potential employer or in marketing your own projects.

Even if you're not asked for your GitHub profile for a job interview: being able to show a convincing profile is a nice bonus which does not cost you very much. And I have some tips for you to tend to these profiles well from the beginning, so that they will offer you maximum value at a minimal effort.

## Choose your nickname carefully

When you create a profile on a site like GitHub or Stack Overflow, choose a nickname which you will still be comfortable with in ten years. It should be one you're not embarassed to mention in a job interview. You should be able to say the nickname without any accompanying excuses. hAXx0Rrul0r or PussyDestroyer are bad examples you should steer clear of. Your name or your initials are probably taken – and to find a nickname which is available on all important platforms without sounding completely bonkers is not easy, but it's worth it to spend the time and think of something you will not regret later on.

## Don't spread your work across different accounts

The better you chose your nickname, the easier it will be to stay on one account. I for one used multiple Twitter accounts for different reasons and lost followers with every switch. Would I have chosen the right nickname and a personal account instead of different ones for different projects, I would have a much bigger network and reach today. Create your accounts carefully and with the aim, to be using it for a long time, if not forever.

## Your profiles are your figurehead

This is true for all your online activities, but even more so for platforms which host your code. You GitHub account is your figurehead and will tell more about your skills than any CV or job interview ever could. Of course you can have a cryptic hidden account for your code garbage to try and obfuscate your dirty dealings – but isn't it easier to write code in a way that you don't mind other people reading it?

Don't be afraid to share your experiments, but write your code with enough effort so you want to share it. You shouldn't have feel like sharing it only with accompanying excuses and explanations. In the end this will help you to write better code: because code that you write not just for yourself or the garbage bin, will necessarily be better, more readable and more beautiful.

## Important platforms for developers

The following platforms are particularly important and helpful to market yourself and your skills:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [Reddit](https://reddit.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

## Summary

- Social media and code hosting platforms are wonderful tools to market yourself, your skills and your own projects
- Choose a nickname which is free on all important platforms and which you will still gladly use in ten years
- Try to write as much code publicly as you can and always keep quality and readability in mind
- Use Twitter, Stack Overflow and Reddit to learn, share your knowledge and to present yourself, your skills and your projects
